# Advent of Code 2021
https://adventofcode.com/2021/

## Organization
Each day's challenges are in their own folder (e.g. `src/day-1`)

The input is in `input.txt` and the solutions are in `part1.ts` and `part2.ts`

(Part 2's solution is copied from Part 1 and adapted as need be)

## Running
> Prerequiste: `yarn install`

`yarn ts-node src/day-X/partY.ts`
